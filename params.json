{"name":"Trainnotifier.co.uk","tagline":"","body":"### About\r\nThis project is aimed at using the [Network Rail Data Feeds](https://datafeeds.networkrail.co.uk/) to help learn some new technologies through an area I am interested in. \r\nI originally intended to do something with the Live Departure Board Web Service until National Rail made it pay-only. \r\nThis site should not be relied on as an accurate source, although the data comes from Network Rail, I cannot guarantee the site will have interpreted the data correctly.\r\n\r\n### Web Client Technologies Used\r\nThe web client uses:\r\n* HTML 5 based around [bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)\r\n* Theme from [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com/)\r\n* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)\r\n* [knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/)\r\n* [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/)\r\n* [Windows Azure](https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/) [Web Sites](https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/home/scenarios/web-sites/)\r\n\r\n### Server Technologies Used\r\nThe server side uses:\r\n* [Alchemy Websockets](http://alchemywebsockets.net/) to handle websocket connections\r\n* [Apache NMS](http://activemq.apache.org/nms/) Stomp (slighlty modified) to connect to the rail data feeds\r\n* ASP.NET MVC Web API for serving data to the web client\r\n* SQL Server 2008 R2\r\n\r\n### In Use\r\nThis site has two URLs.\r\n* (http://www.trainnotifier.co.uk) - this is fully hosted on a Windows Azure Virtual Machine and uses Azure SQL as a backend. This is updated when features have been tested on the site below.\r\n* (http://trainnotifier.azurewebsites.net) - this is hosted on the free Windows Web Sites tier. The backend runs off my own HP Microserver. This is auto-updated from github.\r\n\r\n### About me\r\nI started to do similar stuff years ago (dating back to 2005) using the BBC backstage data to generate a google maps web app and google earth feeds. \r\nThis website is still available but doesnt really work any more, see [http://bbc.blueghost.co.uk](http://bbc.blueghost.co.uk)\r\n\r\n### Thanks\r\nThanks should go to Network Rail for releasing this data, and for the community who helped get them to release it. \r\nSee [the wiki](http://wiki.openraildata.info) for more info. \r\nThanks should also go to Jonathan Brown who originally gave me a list of national rail stations and lat/lon values that I imported into a MySQL database in 2005, sadly the link to the discussion on the Keyhole BBS boards is now broke. I intent to update the list at some point using the open data now available.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nYou can contact me on twitter [@blueghostuk](https://twitter.com/blueghostuk) or [@trainnotifier](https://twitter.com/trainnotifier)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
